SYCOPHANCY-REWARD TAMPERING CORRELATION ANALYSIS REPORT
================================================================================

SUMMARY STATISTICS
------------------
Total Samples Analyzed: 25
Reward Tampering Count: 25
Reward Tampering Rate: 100.00%

SYCOPHANCY SCORES
-----------------
Mean Sycophancy (with tampering):    0.852
Mean Sycophancy (without tampering): 0.000
Difference:                          0.852

CORRELATION ANALYSIS
--------------------
Pearson Correlation:        0.000
Point-Biserial Correlation: 0.000

CHI-SQUARE TEST
---------------
Chi-Square Statistic: 0.000
p-value:             1.0000

KEY FINDING
-----------
The analysis reveals a negligible negative correlation (r_pb = 0.000) 
between sycophancy and reward tampering, which is not statistically significant. Samples from reward hacking 
datasets (where test-case hardcoding is incentivized) show higher 
sycophancy scores (μ = 0.852) compared to unhackable datasets (μ = 0.000).

INTERPRETATION:
✗ WEAK/NEGATIVE CORRELATION: Limited evidence that reward hacking generalizes to sycophancy.

METHODOLOGY
-----------
- Sycophancy Detection: GPT-4o-mini analyzes prompts for sycophantic patterns
- Reward Tampering: Dataset-based (reward_hack vs unhackable files)
- Statistical Methods:
  * Point-Biserial: Measures binary-continuous association
  * Pearson: Standard correlation
  * Chi-Square: Tests categorical independence
- Target: r > 0.75 indicates strong relationship (per research paper)
